# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Project rules

- Stream event types live only in `src/lib/events.ts`; the voice hook and components import from there, never redefine them.
- The API base comes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`).
- No mock data under `src/` outside dev fixtures.
